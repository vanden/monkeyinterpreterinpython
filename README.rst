I'm working through https://interpreterbook.com/ in Go in the repository
https://github.com/vanden/monkeyinterpreteringo

I don't know Go. I figure it will help me learn Go and learn about
interpreters if I don't just follow with the code provided by
https://interpreterbook.com/ but also implement the interpreter myself
in Python.

I expect that the early stages will have a lot of missteps; I'm not even
trying to set up the python structure right until I understand enough of
the Go structure that I am attempting to emulate.
